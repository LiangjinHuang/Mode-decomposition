# Mode-decomposition based on SPGD algorithm.
This repo is to share my work related to SPGD based fiber mode decomposition where I used  MATLAB programming. Inside the repository SPGD_for6mode_main.m is the main procedure, by running it the simulated near-field beam intensity which contains 6 eigenmodes can be decomposed. Of course, you can make changes to the codes to decomposing patterns containing other number of eigenmodes.
