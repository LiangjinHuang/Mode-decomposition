# Mode-decomposition based on SPGD algorithm.
This repo is to share my work related to fiber mode decomposition where I used SPGD algorithm and MATLAB programming.
Please follow these steps to utilize the codes:
a.Download the repository from https://github.com/LiangjinHuang/Mode-decomposition.git
b.Inside the repository you should be able to see all necessary codes written in MATLAB scripting. 
c.SPGD_for6mode_main.m is the main procedure, by running it the simulated near-field beam intensity which contains 6 eigenmodes
can be decomposed. Of course, you can make changes to the codes to decomposing patterns contains other number of eigenmodes.
Thanks for visiting this page.
